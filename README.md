# Advanced Forum

# Project Objectives

In this project, I focused on developing a new and upgraded forum that includes several key features:

## Key Features:

1. **Registration and Login**
   - I implemented a registration and login system where users must register to access the forum. The registration form collects essential information, including:
     - Nickname
     - Age
     - Gender
     - First Name
     - Last Name
     - E-mail
     - Password
   - Users can log in using either their nickname or email, combined with their password.
   - A logout function allows users to sign out from any page on the forum.

2. **Posts and Comments**
   - Users can create posts categorized similarly to the previous forum. 
   - Commenting functionality enables users to respond to posts.
   - I designed a feed display for posts, where users can view posts and access comments by clicking on them.

3. **Private Messages**
   - I developed a chat feature for users to send private messages to one another. This includes:
     - A section displaying online/offline users, organized by the most recent message. New users with no messages are arranged alphabetically.
     - The ability for users to send messages to those online, with this section always visible.
     - When a user clicks on another userâ€™s name, it loads the past messages, displaying the last 10 messages. Scrolling up retrieves an additional 10 messages, implemented with throttling and debouncing techniques to prevent excessive requests.
   - Messages have a specific format that includes:
     - A timestamp indicating when the message was sent.
     - The username of the sender.

## Real-Time Functionality
To ensure a seamless user experience, I integrated WebSockets for real-time messaging. This allows users to receive notifications of new messages instantly without needing to refresh the page.

## Technical Implementation
- **Database**: I used SQLite for data storage, similar to the previous forum.
- **Backend**: The backend was built using Golang to handle data processing and WebSocket communication.
- **Frontend**: JavaScript managed all client-side events and WebSocket interactions, creating a dynamic single-page application (SPA).
- **HTML**: I organized the page elements within a single HTML file, allowing for easy navigation through JavaScript.
- **CSS**: I styled the elements to enhance the user interface.

Through this project, I created a robust and interactive forum that enhances user engagement and communication.
